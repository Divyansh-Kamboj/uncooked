ai_explanation = (b) To solve 2x - 3a < |x - 2a|, consider two cases: Case 1: x - 2a â‰¥ 0, which means x â‰¥ 2a.  The inequality becomes 2x - 3a < x - 2a, simplifying to x < a. Since x must also be â‰¥ 2a, there are no solutions in this case. Case 2: x - 2a < 0, meaning x < 2a. The inequality becomes 2x - 3a < -(x - 2a), which simplifies to 3x < 5a, or x < (5/3)a. Combining this with x < 2a, the solution is x < (5/3)a. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is x < (5/3)a.
